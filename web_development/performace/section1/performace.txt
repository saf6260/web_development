                i.Take code that you have and put it thru UglifyJs(removes whitespace and cleans up space)
            b.Minimize Images 
                i.Change file format that works best for the job
                ii.Jpg:

                    b.Doesn't work well with transparancy 
                iii.GIF:
                    a.Limit color count that saves file size
                iv.PNG:
                    a.Limit color as well to bring down file size
                    b.Often used for logos

                    c.Good for retna and 4k displays
                    d.Simplistic, lack colors
                vi.Compress as much as possible, and pick correct type.
                vii.When to use each type:
                    a.If you want transparancy: use a PNG
                    b.If you want animations:  use a GIF
                    c.If you want colorful images: use a JPG
                    d.If you want simple icons, logos, illustrations: use SVGs
                    e.Reduce PNG with TinyPNG
                    f.Reduce JPG with JPEG-optimizer
                    g.Try to choose simple illustractions over highly detailed photographs

                    i.Resize images based on size it will be displayed
                    j.Display different sized images for different backgrounds
                        1.Do this with media queries:
