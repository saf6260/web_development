Hello and thank you for visiting. This github page is deditcated to my work in learning web development and
all of the tools and skills necessary to becoming the best web developer I can in 2018. I started from the 
basics with HTML and keep continuously learning about newer languages and ways to complete tasks. 

Learning these topics were assisted by online courses over my summer break in 2018. The courses I used and 
thoroughly enjoyed going through were as follows: "The Complete Web Developer in 2018: Zero to Mastery" by Andrei
Neagoie, "The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp" by Colt Steele, and "The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer 
Roadmap" by Andrei Neagoie, along with my own research and by reading documentation online for extra additions. 
The courses can all be found online at www.Udemy.com (I am not sponsored nor own any part of the site, just 
enjoy the learning style and content available). 

Thank you again for visiting and you can see my later applications of everything I learned at www.scottalexf.com
(my website and summer project of summer 2018).
